#CareDay#

##What is Careday?##
###The typical communication tool for day care centers is pen and paper.  We sought to organize the typical tasks into a simple web application.  Day care workers enter data for diapering, sleeping, and eating over the course of a childâ€™s stay. A summary page can be provided to the parent at the end of the day while capturing activity metrics over time for later use. We expect the application can be expanded with additional tasks to be tracked and by adding management reports to track day care operation.
